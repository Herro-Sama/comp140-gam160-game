### Title

In this game the player uses a custom controller to tune into the frequency of explosives which are attached to enemies.
Once they have selected the correct frequency they then push the button to detonate the explosives defeating the enemies.
Enemies will attack the player in waves continually until they reach their target then the game is over. Their target is in the centre of the room. When the player uses the custom controller it will display a value between 1 to 8 which is the frequency range for the enemies. 


### Controller

The controller will be made up of a potentiometer and a push button, these will allow the player to change the frequency in-game as well as confirm their selection. The potentiometer values will be grouped to values between 1 and 8, which will be displayed on screen. The controller is very simple but the game had to have considerations for the mechanical limitations created by the potentiometer as it isn't possible to quickly cycle between states.
