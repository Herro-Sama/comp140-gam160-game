###Title

In this game the player uses a custom controller to tune into the frequncy of explosives which are attached to enemies.
Once they have selected the correct frequency they then push the button to detonate the explosives defeating the enemies.
Enemies will attack the player in waves continually until they reach the player then the game is over.


The controller will be made up of a variable resistor and a push button, these will allow the player to change the frequency in-game as well as confirm their selection.
